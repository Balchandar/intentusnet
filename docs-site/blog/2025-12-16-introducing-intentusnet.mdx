title: Introducing IntentusNet - Deterministic Execution for Multi-Agent AI
authors: [balachandar]

Today we're releasing IntentusNet, a deterministic execution runtime for multi-agent AI systems. IntentusNet makes routing, fallback, and failure behavior **replayable, explainable, and production-operable**.

## The Problem

Multi-agent AI systems are fundamentally non-deterministic. When you deploy agents in production, you face:

- **Non-deterministic routing**: Agent selection varies between runs
- **Silent failures**: Errors disappear without trace
- **Unreplayable executions**: Cannot reproduce issues
- **Debugging nightmares**: "Why did the system do that?"

These aren't edge cases—they're daily realities for teams running AI agents in production.

## Our Approach

IntentusNet is a **runtime layer** that sits beneath agent frameworks to make execution deterministic and debuggable. It's not an agent framework—it doesn't define prompts, call LLMs, or orchestrate workflows. Instead, it ensures:

1. **Deterministic Routing**: Same input → same agent selection, always
2. **Execution Recording**: Every execution captured with stable hashes
3. **Replay Without Re-execution**: Return recorded outputs, no model calls
4. **Policy Filtering**: Fine-grained control with partial continuation

## Quick Example

```python
from intentusnet import IntentusRuntime

# Create runtime with recording enabled
runtime = IntentusRuntime(enable_recording=True)

# Register your agents
# ... agent registration ...

# Execute intent - deterministically routed
response = runtime.router.route_intent(envelope)

# Later: replay returns exact same output
replay_result = runtime.replay(execution_id)
```

## What's in v1.3.0

- **Core Runtime**: Deterministic routing, execution recording, replay engine
- **Policy Engine**: Allow/deny rules with partial filtering
- **Multiple Transports**: In-process, HTTP, WebSocket, ZeroMQ
- **MCP Adapter**: Bridge to Model Context Protocol
- **Comprehensive CLI**: Inspect, replay, validate, estimate

## Philosophy

IntentusNet is built on a core belief:

> The model may change. The execution must not.

AI systems are inherently unpredictable. Models update, confidence scores shift, and outputs vary. But the **execution infrastructure** should be rock-solid—deterministic, auditable, and recoverable.

Think of it like systemd for AI agents: it doesn't write your service, but it ensures reliable execution semantics.

## Get Started

```bash
pip install intentusnet
```

Check out the [documentation](/docs/getting-started/install) to get started.

## What's Next

We're working on:

- WAL-backed persistence for stronger durability guarantees
- Async routing support
- Additional execution stores (PostgreSQL, Redis)
- Enhanced cost estimation
