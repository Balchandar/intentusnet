We're excited to announce IntentusNet v1.3.0, bringing execution recording, deterministic replay, and improved stability to the runtime.

<!-- truncate -->

## What's New

### Execution Recording & Replay

The headline feature of v1.3.0 is the execution recording and replay system:

```python
# Enable recording
runtime = IntentusRuntime(enable_recording=True)

# Execute
response = runtime.router.route_intent(envelope)
execution_id = response.metadata["execution_id"]

# Later: replay returns exact same output
engine = ReplayEngine(store.load(execution_id))
result = engine.replay()  # No model calls, exact output
```

Every execution is now captured with:

- Stable envelope hash for integrity
- Step-by-step event trace
- Complete final response
- Replayability status

### Determinism Hardening

We've strengthened determinism guarantees:

- Agent ordering now uses explicit `nodePriority` field
- Sequence numbers replace timestamps for event ordering
- Canonical JSON ensures consistent hashing

### Public API Cleanup

The public API has been refined:

- Clear separation between public and internal modules
- Type hints throughout
- Comprehensive docstrings
- Stable export list in `__init__.py`

### New `replayableReason` Field

When a record can't be replayed, the reason is now explicit:

```json
{
  "header": {
    "replayable": false,
    "replayableReason": "execution_incomplete"
  }
}
```

## Breaking Changes

### Removed

- `IntentRouter.route()` - use `route_intent()` instead
- Legacy envelope format v1.x

### Changed

- `AgentDefinition.priority` renamed to `nodePriority` for clarity
- Event timestamps are now supplementary; sequence numbers are authoritative

## Upgrade Guide

1. Update imports:

   ```python
   # Old
   from intentusnet.router import IntentRouter

   # New
   from intentusnet import IntentRouter
   ```

2. Update agent definitions:

   ```python
   # Old
   AgentDefinition(priority=10, ...)

   # New
   AgentDefinition(nodePriority=10, ...)
   ```

3. Enable recording for replay:
   ```python
   runtime = IntentusRuntime(enable_recording=True)
   ```

## What's Next

For v1.4.0, we're planning:

- Async routing support
- Built-in timeout handling
- WAL-backed persistence
- Additional execution stores

## Get It

```bash
pip install intentusnet==1.3.0
```
