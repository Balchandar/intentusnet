# Runtime Guarantees Overview

IntentusNet provides explicit, documented guarantees for production multi-agent systems. This section details what the runtime promises, what it doesn't promise, and the failure modes you should expect.

## The Guarantee Contract

Every production runtime needs a clear contract. IntentusNet's contract is:

| Guarantee                   | Status          | Description                               |
| --------------------------- | --------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Deterministic Routing       | **Provided**    | Same input → same agent selection order   |
| Execution Recording         | **Provided**    | Every execution captured with stable hash |
| Replay Without Re-execution | **Provided**    | Return recorded output, no model calls    |
| Policy Filtering            | **Provided**    | Partial allow/deny with continuation      |
| Structured Errors           | **Provided**    | Typed error codes, no silent failures     |
| Crash Recovery              | **Design Goal** | WAL-backed state persistence              |

:::note Design Goals vs. Implemented Guarantees
Features marked as "Design Goal" are architecturally planned but may have implementation limitations in the current version. See individual guarantee pages for details.

## Quick Reference

### What IS Guaranteed (v1.3.x)

```
✓ Deterministic agent ordering
✓ Single response per intent
✓ Execution recording with stable hashes
✓ Replay returns recorded outputs
✓ Typed error codes (ErrorCode enum)
✓ Trace span emission for every decision
✓ Policy allow/deny evaluation
```

### What is NOT Guaranteed

```
✗ Automatic retries (explicit fallback only)
✗ Transaction rollback (agents responsible)
✗ Distributed consensus
✗ Load balancing
✗ Rate limiting (policy layer, not runtime)
✗ Agent internal determinism
```

## Guarantee Categories

### 1. Routing Guarantees

IntentusNet guarantees **deterministic agent selection**:

- Given the same intent and available agents, routing produces the same order
- Ordering based on: `(isLocal DESC, nodePriority ASC, agentName ASC)`
- No implicit retries or hidden load balancing
- Explicit fallback via routing strategy

### 2. Execution Recording Guarantees

IntentusNet guarantees **complete execution capture**:

- Every execution produces an `ExecutionRecord`
- Envelope hash computed via SHA-256 for integrity
- Events recorded with deterministic sequence numbers
- Final response captured exactly as produced

[Read more: Crash-Safe Execution →](./crash-safe-execution)

### 3. Replay Guarantees

IntentusNet guarantees **deterministic replay**:

- Replay returns the recorded output, not a re-execution
- No model calls during replay
- Envelope hash validation available
- Explicit `replayable` flag on records

[Read more: Replayability →](./replayability)

### 4. Policy Guarantees

IntentusNet guarantees **policy evaluation**:

- Policies evaluated before execution
- Partial filtering: deny specific targets, allow rest
- Clear denial reasons in response
- No silent blocking

[Read more: Policy Filtering →](./policy-filtering)

### 5. Observability Guarantees

IntentusNet guarantees **structured output**:

- Every routing decision produces a `TraceSpan`
- JSON-structured outputs for CLI tooling
- Execution IDs for cross-reference
- Error codes from defined enum

## Failure Modes

IntentusNet makes failure modes explicit:

| Failure             | Behavior                         | Recovery                     |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| No matching agent   | `CAPABILITY_NOT_FOUND` error     | Register appropriate agent   |
| Agent error         | Error propagated, recorded       | Retry with fallback strategy |
| Policy denial       | Partial execution or full denial | Adjust policy rules          |
| Crash mid-execution | Recorded events preserved        | Replay from last checkpoint  |
| Invalid envelope    | `VALIDATION_ERROR`               | Fix envelope structure       |

## Guarantee Versions

Guarantees may evolve across versions:

| Version         | Key Guarantees Added                |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| 0.1.x           | Basic routing, registry             |
| 0.2.x           | Execution recording, trace spans    |
| 0.3.x           | Replay engine, stable hashes        |
| 0.4.x (planned) | Enhanced WAL, distributed recording |

## Verifying Guarantees

You can verify IntentusNet's guarantees programmatically:

```python
from intentusnet import IntentusRuntime, IntentEnvelope

runtime = IntentusRuntime(enable_recording=True)

# Verify deterministic routing
envelope = create_test_envelope()
results = [runtime.router.route_intent(envelope) for _ in range(10)]

# All should select same agent
agents = set(r.metadata.get('selected_agent') for r in results)
assert len(agents) == 1, "Routing is non-deterministic"

# Verify recording
execution_id = results[0].metadata.get('execution_id')
assert execution_id is not None, "Execution not recorded"

# Verify replay
replay_result = runtime.replay(execution_id)
assert replay_result.payload == results[0].payload, "Replay mismatch"
```
