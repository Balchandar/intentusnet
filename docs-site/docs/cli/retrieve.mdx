# intentusnet retrieve

Retrieve the stored response from a recorded execution. This is a **lookup operation**, not re-execution—no agent code runs, no routing occurs.

:::info Important Semantic Note
The `retrieve` command returns the stored `finalResponse` exactly as recorded. It does not re-execute agent code or validate that the current system would produce the same result.
:::

## Synopsis

```bash
intentusnet retrieve <execution_id> [options]
```

## Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--dry-run` | Show what would be retrieved without returning full response |
| `--output FILE` | Write result to file |

## Examples

### Basic Retrieval

```bash
intentusnet retrieve exec-a1b2c3d4
```

Output:

```json
{
  "execution_id": "exec-a1b2c3d4",
  "response": {
    "status": "success",
    "payload": {
      "result": "processed",
      "data": "original output"
    }
  },
  "envelope_hash_ok": true,
  "retrieval_timestamp": "2026-02-04T10:30:00.123456Z",
  "warning": "This is the RECORDED response from execution time. No agent code was executed. No routing occurred. This is a historical lookup, NOT re-execution."
}
```

### Dry Run

Check if a response is retrievable without returning the full response:

```bash
intentusnet retrieve exec-a1b2c3d4 --dry-run
```

```json
{
  "dry_run": true,
  "execution_id": "exec-a1b2c3d4",
  "retrievable": true,
  "response": {...},
  "warning": "This is the RECORDED response from execution time..."
}
```

### Write to File

```bash
intentusnet retrieve exec-a1b2c3d4 --output result.json
```

## Non-Retrievable Records

When a record does not have a stored response:

```bash
intentusnet retrieve exec-incomplete
```

```
Error: Historical response not retrievable: execution_incomplete
```

Exit code: `1`

## Use Cases

### Debugging

Retrieve exact output for debugging:

```bash
# User reports issue
intentusnet retrieve exec-a1b2c3d4 > debug_output.json
```

### Auditing

Demonstrate what was returned at a point in time:

```bash
# Auditor request
intentusnet retrieve exec-a1b2c3d4 --output audit_record.json
```

### Cost Avoidance

Return stored response instead of re-executing expensive operations:

```bash
# Check if already executed
EXISTING=$(intentusnet records list --output json | jq -r '.[0].execution_id')

if [ -n "$EXISTING" ]; then
    # Retrieve stored response
    intentusnet retrieve $EXISTING
else
    # Execute new
    intentusnet run --intent ExpensiveIntent --payload @data.json
fi
```

## Deprecated: replay Command

The `replay` command is deprecated. Use `retrieve` instead.

```bash
# Deprecated (emits warning)
intentusnet replay exec-a1b2c3d4

# Preferred
intentusnet retrieve exec-a1b2c3d4
```

The terminology change reflects the actual behavior: this is **retrieval** (lookup of stored data), not **replay** (which incorrectly implies re-execution).

## Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0 | Success |
| 1 | General error / not retrievable |
| 10 | Record not found |
