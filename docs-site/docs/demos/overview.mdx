# Demos Overview

These demos illustrate IntentusNet's core capabilities with realistic scenarios. Each demo includes input, routing decision, policy evaluation, execution trace, and replay verification.

## Available Demos

| Demo | Capability Demonstrated |
|------|------------------------|
| [Dangerous Target Filtering](./dangerous-target-filtering) | Policy filtering protects CCTV while allowing other systems |
| [Crash Recovery](./crash-recovery) | Mid-execution crash recovery with deterministic resume |
| [Model Swap Prevention](./model-swap-prevention) | Deterministic routing prevents behavioral drift |
| [Project Blackbox](./project-blackbox) | 8-act end-to-end proof of all deterministic guarantees (v4.5) |

## Demo Format

Each demo follows a consistent format:

1. **Scenario**: Real-world situation
2. **Input Intent**: The request being made
3. **Route Result**: Which agent(s) were selected
4. **Policy Decision**: What was allowed/denied
5. **Execution Trace**: Step-by-step events
6. **Replay Note**: How replay applies

## Running the Demos

All demos are runnable Python scripts:

```bash
# Install IntentusNet
pip install intentusnet

# Clone examples
git clone https://github.com/Balchandar/intentusnet
cd intentusnet/examples/demos

# Run a demo
python dangerous_target_filtering.py
python crash_recovery.py
python model_swap_prevention.py
```

## Key Takeaways

After running these demos, you'll understand:

- **Policy filtering** protects critical systems without blocking entire intents
- **Crash recovery** identifies failure points and enables safe resume
- **Deterministic routing** ensures consistent agent selection regardless of external changes
- **Replay** returns exact recorded outputs for debugging and auditing
- **Provable determinism** can be verified through execution fingerprinting and drift detection
