# IntentusNet v1.5.1 — Provable Determinism

**Released:** 2026-02-12

## Summary

IntentusNet v1.5.1 introduces **provable determinism** — execution behavior can now be cryptographically verified, drift-detected, and CI-enforced. Determinism is no longer just a design property; it is a measurable, enforceable guarantee.

## New Features

### Execution Fingerprinting

Every execution produces a **SHA-256 fingerprint** computed from the intent sequence, agent call sequence, parameter hashes, output hashes, retry pattern, execution order, and timeout values.

- Same input + same runtime = same fingerprint
- Fingerprint mismatch = nondeterminism detected

### Deterministic-Safe CI/CD Pipeline

A 9-gate verification pipeline enforces determinism before deployment:

| Gate | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Build Reproducibility | Same source → same binary SHA-256 |
| Deterministic Execution | Same input → same fingerprint across N runs |
| WAL Replay Final-State | Replayed response hash matches original |
| Entropy Detection | Static scan blocks unseeded randomness |
| Container Reproducibility | Same Dockerfile → same image hash |
| Routing Determinism | Same capabilities → same agent selection |
| Crash Recovery | Side-effect-aware resume/block decisions |
| WAL Integrity & Tamper | Hash chain + Ed25519 signature verification |
| Runtime Snapshot | Serialization round-trip integrity |

All 9 gates must pass. A single failure blocks deployment.

### Drift Detection

Automatic detection of nondeterministic execution through fingerprint comparison across runs.

### WAL Replay Verification

Stored responses can be proven to match original execution by comparing content hashes.

### Entropy Scanning

Static analysis gate scans deterministic-critical code paths for unseeded randomness, `uuid4()` in step IDs, `time()` in hashes, and `os.urandom()` in hash computation.

### Project Blackbox Demo

An 8-act end-to-end demonstration proving all deterministic guarantees. See [Project Blackbox](../demos/project-blackbox).

## New CI Gate Scripts

| Script | Gate |
|--------|------|
| `gate_deterministic_execution.py` | Evaluation report thresholds |
| `gate_wal_replay_state.py` | WAL replay hash verification |
| `gate_entropy_detection.py` | Static entropy scanning |
| `gate_routing_determinism.py` | Agent selection determinism |
| `gate_crash_recovery.py` | Recovery decision correctness |
| `gate_wal_integrity.py` | Hash chain and signature verification |
| `gate_runtime_snapshot.py` | Serialization round-trip verification |

## Updated Guarantees

Three new guarantees added to the execution contract:

| Guarantee | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| Execution Fingerprinting | **Provided (v1.5.1)** |
| Deterministic-Safe CI/CD | **Provided (v1.5.1)** |
| Drift Detection | **Provided (v1.5.1)** |

## Breaking Changes

None. v1.5.1 is fully backward-compatible with v1.x.

## Migration

No migration required. New features are additive.
