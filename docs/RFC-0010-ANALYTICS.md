# RFC-0010: IntentusNet Analytics & Metrics

## Status
Draft

## Abstract
This RFC defines the **Analytics and Metrics** system for IntentusNet, ensuring observability, performance monitoring, and actionable insights for agents, orchestrators, and intent flows.

---

## 1. Metrics Types

1. **Intent Metrics**
   - Number of intents processed per agent
   - Success/failure rate
   - Latency per intent
2. **Agent Metrics**
   - Load (current active requests)
   - Availability and uptime
   - Response times
3. **System Metrics**
   - Network throughput
   - Orchestrator decision latency
   - Fallback usage statistics

---

## 2. Data Collection

- Metrics are collected in real-time or near-real-time.
- Agents, orchestrators, and gateways push metrics to a **central analytics engine**.
- Optional aggregation can occur at edge nodes for distributed setups.

---

## 3. Logging & Tracing Integration

- Metrics are correlated with **IntentusNet Tracer logs** (RFC-0006).
- Each intent event can be traced to the handling agent, decision path, and routing decisions.

---

## 4. Security & Privacy

- Analytics data must **not expose sensitive payloads**.
- Only metadata and performance indicators are collected.
- Access to analytics dashboards and APIs is controlled via **JWT or role-based permissions**.

---

## 5. Visualization & Reporting

- Standardized metrics allow:
  - Dashboards for monitoring agent health
  - Performance trend analysis
  - Alerts for SLA violations or high latency

---

## 6. Use Cases

- Identify bottlenecks in intent routing.
- Monitor agent reliability and load.
- Ensure SLA compliance and detect anomalies.

---

## Notes

- Metrics should be compatible with Prometheus, Grafana, or other monitoring stacks.
- Optional: support export in JSON, CSV, or other machine-readable formats.
