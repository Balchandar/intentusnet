# RFC-0009: IntentusNet Orchestrator & Routing Logic

## Status
Draft

## Abstract
This RFC defines the **Orchestrator and Routing Logic** for IntentusNet, specifying how intents are routed to agents based on priority, capability, fallback, and qualifiers.

---

## 1. Orchestrator Overview

- The Orchestrator is responsible for **routing intents** to the most suitable agent.
- It ensures **efficient, secure, and deterministic delivery**.

---

## 2. Routing Inputs

- `intent_id`
- `capabilities_required`
- `priority_levels`
- `agent_status` (active, load, last_seen)
- `qualifiers` (optional constraints)
- `EMCL verification result`

---

## 3. Routing Algorithm

1. Filter agents by **capability and active status**.
2. Apply **priority sorting** (lower number = higher priority).
3. Apply **qualifiers** (if present).
4. Check **security compatibility** (EMCL verification).
5. Select the first suitable agent.
6. If no agent found, trigger **fallback agents** based on priority list.

---

## 4. Fallback & Retry

- Fallback is triggered when:
  - High-priority agent is unavailable.
  - Agent fails to process the intent within timeout.
- Retry is configurable:
  - Max retries per intent.
  - Backoff strategy (exponential, linear, or fixed).

---

## 5. Logging & Tracing

- Every routing decision is logged in the **IntentusNet Tracer** (RFC-0006).
- Logs include:
  - Selected agent
  - Fallbacks used
  - Qualifiers applied
  - Latency
  - Status (success, failed, pending)

---

## 6. Security & Compliance

- Orchestrator must validate **EMCL envelope** before routing.
- Unauthorized or expired intents must be rejected.
- Routing decisions must not leak sensitive information about other agents or clients.

---

## 7. Use Cases

- Ensuring high availability with fallback routing.
- Maintaining deterministic and auditable intent delivery.
- Supporting dynamic scaling and agent load balancing.

---

## Notes

- Orchestrator may be centralized or distributed.
- Optional: integrate with metrics systems for monitoring intent flow and performance.
