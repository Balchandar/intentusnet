# IntentusNet

**IntentusNet** is a next-generation protocol for secure, intent-based communication between agents.  
It builds on the [Encrypted Model Context Layer (EMCL)](https://github.com/Balchandar/emcl-protocol) and extends the ideas from [IXP](https://github.com/Balchandar/IXP) into a complete framework for **routing, registry, and observability**.

## âœ¨ Key Features
- ðŸ”’ **Secure envelopes** â€” all messages use EMCL for signing, encryption, and replay protection.
- ðŸ§­ **Intent-based routing** â€” agents are addressed by *intents* (e.g., `summarize.text`) instead of raw endpoints.
- ðŸ“‘ **Agent registry** â€” declarative adverts with trust scores, health metrics, and priority.
- ðŸ”„ **Routing modes** â€” `FIRST_OK`, `ALL`, `RACE`, `MAJORITY`, with fallback and qualifier relaxation.
- ðŸ›  **Transport adapters** â€” ZeroMQ (MVP), gRPC (planned), extensible for custom backends.
- ðŸ“Š **Observability** â€” trace IDs, policy redaction, metrics for latency, fallback %, and health.
- ðŸ“¦ **SDKs** â€” minimal client libraries in **TypeScript** and **Python**.
