# Contributing Guide

Thank you for your interest in contributing.  
Contributions of all kinds—bug reports, documentation improvements, and code
changes—are welcome.

This document outlines the expectations and workflow for contributing to this
project.

---

## Before You Start

Before opening an issue or pull request, please:

- Review existing issues and pull requests to avoid duplication
- Open an issue to discuss significant changes or new features
- Ensure your contribution aligns with the project’s goals and scope

Large or breaking changes should always be discussed before implementation.

---

## Ways to Contribute

You can contribute by:

- Reporting bugs
- Improving documentation
- Proposing features or enhancements
- Submitting code changes
- Reviewing pull requests

Each contribution helps improve the project.

---

## Development Workflow

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new branch from `main`
3. Make your changes
4. Add or update tests where applicable
5. Ensure the project builds and tests pass
6. Submit a pull request

---

## Branching Strategy

- `main` represents the stable, production-ready state
- Feature branches should follow these patterns:
  - `feat/<short-description>`
  - `fix/<short-description>`
  - `docs/<short-description>`

---

## Commit Messages

- Write clear, concise commit messages
- Keep commits focused and logically scoped
- Avoid combining unrelated changes in a single commit

---

## Pull Request Guidelines

Pull requests should:

- Address a single concern or feature
- Include tests if behavior or logic changes
- Update documentation for any public API changes
- Avoid introducing breaking changes without prior discussion

All pull requests are reviewed before merging.

---

## Code Quality Expectations

Contributions are expected to:

- Follow existing code style and conventions
- Favor clarity and maintainability over cleverness
- Avoid introducing unnecessary abstractions
- Preserve backward compatibility whenever possible

Changes that significantly affect architecture or public interfaces may
require additional review.

---

## Documentation

Documentation is considered part of the product.

If your change affects usage, configuration, or public behavior, please update
the relevant documentation accordingly.

---

## Issue Reporting

When reporting issues, please include:

- A clear description of the problem
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected and actual behavior
- Relevant environment details

Well-structured issues help resolve problems faster.

---

## Review Process

All contributions are reviewed for:

- Technical correctness
- Alignment with project goals
- Code clarity and maintainability

Feedback may include requests for changes or clarification.  
Maintainers reserve the right to decline contributions that do not align with
the project’s direction.

---

## Code of Conduct

All contributors are expected to follow the
[Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
